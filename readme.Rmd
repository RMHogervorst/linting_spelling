# Goals
I want to create a set of scripts that I can 
call in every pull request of the blog. 
I actually described some part in the wishlist of rconsortium [1].


The scripts need to:

[] read the code and lint for common style mistakes
[] read the text in the blogpost and spell check the content
[] calculate text difficulty 
[] optinally return some suggestions for improvement


## Suggestions so far:

- hunspell can do variety of languages spell checking. 
- readability can be determined with koRpus package
- linting can be done with lintr

Idea: create a script for travis-ci so that checks are done. 
pref. check only latest addition. 

ultimately a seperate github integration would be nicer.
